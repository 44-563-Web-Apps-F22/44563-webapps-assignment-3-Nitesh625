    <p>Needlefish (family Belonidae) or long toms[2] are piscivorous fishes primarily associated with
     very shallow marine habitats or the surface of the open sea. Some genera include species found in
     marine, brackish, and freshwater environments (e.g., Strongylura), while a few genera are confined 
     to freshwater rivers and streams, including Belonion, Potamorrhaphis, and Xenentodon.</p>
